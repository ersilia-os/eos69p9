    "Title": "Toxicity prediction across the Tox21 panel with semi-supervised learning",
    "Description": "Toxicity prediction across the Tox21 panel from MoleculeNet, comprising 12 toxicity pathways. The model uses the Mean Teacher Semi-Supervised Learning (MT-SSL) approach to overcome the low number of data points experimentally annotated for toxicity tasks. For the MT-SSL, Tox21 (831 compounds and 12 different endpoints) was used as labeled data and a selection of 50K compounds from other MoleculeNet datasets was used as unlabeled data.\n",
